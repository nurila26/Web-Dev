<p>Today I started learning HTML and CSS. I was amazed at how I could change the way a page looks with just a few lines of code! I created my first headings and paragraphs, and even added some styling to them. Feeling proud already!</p>

<p>This week I learned about internal links and tables. I made a small recipe page with a table of ingredients and linked to each recipe from a contents list. It's really exciting to see how HTML and CSS come together to make a page not just functional, but also visually appealing.</p>
